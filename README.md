## Metrics
The following are metrics for deciding if a given permutation is good:
1. What is the nimimum rest time (in % with respect to the last shift duration) among all assignees.
2. What is the maximum rest time (in % in the last 72 hours).
3. Standard diviation of rest time (in % with respect to the soldier's shifts) across all soldiers. We want that to be as low as possible.
